# ShovelBot
*A modular bot for streamers*

### What is ShovelBot?
ShovelBot is a modular bot framework designed to help streamers interact with 
their audiences. It alone does nothing, but with its extension framework, you 
can do essentially anything you can think of.

### What are extensions?
Extensions are standard Python modules the bot can understand.  Extensions are 
defined as extensions of the `core.utils.Extension` base class, *or* 
`core.utils.Platform` for defining platform integrations.
