## Submitting Issues
Issues are by no means bound to the following guidelines, but they are generally
a good guide to follow for submitting issues.

Before you submit an issue, you should check if someone already submitted an issue
that is *similiar* or ***exact***.  If you could not find an issue, you can proceed
to submit your issue.

By submitting an issue, you should provide accurate and detailed information about
the purpose of the issue.  If you're submitting a bug report, you should provide
basic information about how you've set up your copy of ShovelBot.  The list of
integrations and modules you've added, your current settings, and any modifications
you've made.  A detailed explaination of how you've encountered this bug is helpful.

If your modifications heavily alter the bot's version's code, you may not receive
support for your bug unless it's reproducable with the unaltered version of your bot.
That being said, any modifications you've made are your problem and yours alone.

Submitting feature requests have a seperate guideline. Feature requests should explain
your request in as much detail as possible.  Additional information may be included to
increase your request's odds of being integrated.  Additional information you can
