#### What happened?
Did ShovelBot start dancing on table tops?
Did it start telling you incredible jokes that had you laughing for hours at a time?
Perhaps it started writing epic novels about lost love or incredible feats of heroism?

Whatever the case may be, it probably shouldn't be doing it.  That's where this template
comes in!  It will give you a general idea of how you should report an issue.  This section
is all about what happened.


#### What should've happened?
Generally, all features should have *some* documentation.  If there isn't documentation,
you should write that here.


#### Requirements
This section shouldn't be included in an issue report, but maybe you'll find something you
missed once you submit it.  On that note, you should include a few things with every issue
report:

* Your log file
* (Optionally) A diagnostics file
